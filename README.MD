The item groups are bit jank since I just pulled out and mildly tweaked old ones.
They will break again once the obsoleted guns are fully removed from the game files.

Some monsters had to get pruned cause the ones they came from (golden goose and a feral) got removed from base game.

ATM terrain updated into ATM Furniture (Off)

EOC was (hopefully) updated to use the new syntax.

EOC to change monsters tweaked to using 'if, then, else' It shear size makes the game think its in an infinite loop. Thanks for GuardianDL for cleaning it up.

relic data & passive effects (hopefully) updated to use the new format for bonus damage and damage reduction.

Battery pocket updated and atomic battery references removed.

Monster Harvest fields updated. Most were using the obsolated "zombie" harvest group. Tried to used base game harvest types to match the monster.

Power usage was tweaked. Maybe far too low but I'm pretty sure since the last time this mod was updated battery stuff changed twice.

No real direct testing. Just been playing with it in my current game and seeing what happens.
