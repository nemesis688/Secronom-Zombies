- Built againsts experimental '2025-01-12-1820' still worked in '2025-01-14-1553'


The item groups are bit jank since I just pulled out and mildly tweaked old ones.
They will break again once the obsoleted guns are fully removed from the game files.

Some monsters had to get pruned cause the ones they came from (golden goose and a feral) got removed from base game.

ATM terrain updated into ATM Furniture (Off)

EOC was (hopefully) updated to use the new syntax.

relic data & passive effects (hopefully) updated to use the new format for bonus damage and damage reduction.

Battery pocket updated and atomic battery references removed.

Monster Harvest fields updated. Most were using the obsolated "zombie" harvest group. Tried to used base game harvest types to match the monster.


The only testing I did was that I could launch into a new game (new world and new character) without any errors.
